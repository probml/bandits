## Installation

```
pip install fire
pip install ml-collections
```

## Reproduce the results

There are two ways to reproduce the results from the paper

### Run the scripts

To reproduce the results, `cd` into the project folder and run

```bash
python bandits test
```

```bash
python bandits run_and_plot
```

### Step by step

If you only want to reproduce the results, run

```bash
python bandits run_experiments
```

If you have previously reproduced the results and want to reproduce the plots, run

```bash
python bandits plot_experiments
```

The results will be stored inside `bandits/figures/`.

### Execute the notebooks

An alternative way to reproduce the results is to simply open and run [`subspace_bandits.ipynb`](https://github.com/probml/bandits/blob/main/bandits/scripts/subspace_bandits.ipynb)
